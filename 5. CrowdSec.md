## 🔧 Configure CrowdSec on Windows
- Unlike Linux, Windows installation does **not** support automatic configuration.
- To detect threats beyond RDP or SMB brute force, manual configuration is required.

1. Open **PowerShell as Administrator** in the CrowdSec folder.
2. Run the following command:
   ```powershell
   .\cscli collections install crowdsecurity/windows-firewall
   ```
3. Open the `acquis.yaml` file located in:
   ```
   C:\ProgramData\CrowdSec\config
   ```
4. Add the necessary configuration.
5. Reboot the computer.
