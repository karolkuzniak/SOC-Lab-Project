SOC Lab Project

In today's cybersecurity landscape, understanding and implementing Security Operations Center (SOC) principles is crucial for both professionals and enthusiasts. This project aims to demonstrate how to build a functional SOC lab at home using accessible tools and technologies. By setting up this lab, you can simulate real-world scenarios, analyze potential threats, and enhance your cybersecurity skills in a controlled environment.

The lab is structured into several key components, each designed to replicate an essential aspect of a SOC:

- pfSense: A robust open-source firewall for securing network traffic and managing access control.

- Active Directory: A central identity and access management system for user authentication and authorization.

- Windows Workstation: A simulated endpoint to represent user devices in a corporate network.

- Sysmon: A powerful system monitoring tool to collect detailed logs for forensic and threat analysis.

- CrowdSec: A collaborative and open-source cybersecurity tool for proactive threat detection and prevention.


By integrating these components, this project provides a comprehensive guide to setting up a SOC lab, empowering users to monitor, analyze, and secure their home network effectively. Whether you are a student, a professional, or simply curious about cybersecurity, this guide will help you take the first steps toward mastering SOC operations.
